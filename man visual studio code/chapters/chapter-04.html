            <summary class="section-toggle">4.1 Being Seen, Being Watched</summary>
            <div class="section-content">
                <p>In the extended essay "SUBLIMINALITATIONS" in <em>Shadowbook</em>, the author develops a theory of what we might call the affectionate panopticon—the experience of performing one's life for an imagined viewer who watches through the lens of the phone.</p>
                
                <p>The classic panopticon, as theorized by Foucault, is a prison design where inmates are visible to guards but can't see whether they're being watched. This uncertainty creates self-discipline: you behave as if always watched because you might be. The smartphone inverts this in curious ways. We post to social media knowing (hoping) we're being seen, but not knowing by whom or when. We perform our lives through the phone's camera, creating content for an audience that's simultaneously specific (our followers, friends, contacts) and abstract (anyone who might view it).</p>
                
                <p>As the author writes: "I look in the mirror, I brush my hair, I get dressed. There's nothing sexual about it... Plain and simple, it just matters that someone is watching while I go about my morning routine."</p>
                
                <p>This watching isn't oppressive (or not only oppressive)—it's affirming. To be watched is to matter, to exist, to be worthy of attention. The phone mediates this watching, makes it possible, sustains it even when no one may actually be looking. The possibility of being seen becomes as important as actually being seen.</p>
                
                <p>The essay describes performing daily routines "for the camera, which basically means I get up for him." This "him" is both specific person and abstracted other, someone real and someone imagined. The phone creates the possibility of this watching, hosts it, makes it feel real even when it might be entirely constructed.</p>

            <summary class="section-toggle">4.2 The Architecture of the Dome</summary>
            <div class="section-content">
                <p><em>Shadowbook</em> introduces the metaphor of "the dome"—a structure that surrounds the self, created through the awareness of being watched. "From this crown a bouquet of cameras seems to sprout, their heads down, peeking about like just so many flowers."</p>
                
                <p>This is not surveillance in the oppressive sense—or not only that. It's also affirmation, existence, mattering. The phone connects us to these watching eyes, makes us visible, confirms that we exist beyond our own consciousness of ourselves. "The camera ensures a view of the self from the outside, which is the impossible view and the affirming view."</p>
                
                <p>The dome is mobile, following us through our days. The phone is both the portal to this watched space and the eye through which others see us. We've become both prisoner and guard in our own personal panopticons, watching ourselves being watched, performing for an audience we've partly imagined into being.</p>
                
                <p>The essay develops this extensively: "Whereas it started with a compliment, it quickly turned into an architecture. I mentioned the dome. A dome that flexibly follows me around, moves with me wherever I go, and keeps me safeguarded right in the middle of its structure, under its crown so to say."</p>
                
                <p>This architecture provides structure, safety, meaning. The author describes "a feeling of security, especially since that someone isn't an almighty, all-seeing god, judging and damning and making us stick to the rules. No, that's not the case anymore, this is someone who looks at you (me) because he's interested."</p>
                
                <p>The phone makes this architecture possible, hosts it, sustains it. Through the phone, we're connected to others' attention, their interest, their affirmation. The phone becomes the infrastructure of contemporary self-making, the scaffolding on which we construct our sense of being seen and therefore being real.</p>

            <summary class="section-toggle">4.3 The Feedback Loop</summary>
            <div class="section-content">
                <p>The dome creates what <em>Shadowbook</em> calls "feedback loops"—circuits where attention and performance flow in circles, from self to other back to self, from interior to exterior back to interior, from the body to the screen and back to the body.</p>
                
                <p>"Another feedback loop: this one runs from me to the third eye (oh, the third eye) that permits the impossible yet so important view of myself from the outside, thus affirming my very existence, then floats back into myself again, applying the third-eye-look on him."</p>
                
                <p>The phone enables these loops, accelerates them, makes them continuous rather than occasional. We post a photo and watch the likes accumulate, each one a confirmation that we're being seen. We share a thought and read the comments, each one feeding back into our sense of self. The phone shows us ourselves being seen, makes visible what would otherwise remain invisible.</p>
                
                <p>These feedback loops shape behavior. We learn what gets attention, what generates response, what makes us visible. The phone's metrics—likes, retweets, comments, shares—quantify attention in ways that can be addictive. Each notification triggers a little burst of pleasure, a confirmation of existence, a moment of affirmation.</p>
                
                <p>But the loops can also be destructive. The author describes how "All of a sudden while scrolling through your timeline you're confronted with the suicide bomber who blows himself up in Departures, a constant loop shows you more of the same and more and more whether you want it to or not."</p>
                
                <p>The gif, which <em>Shadowbook</em> discusses extensively as a metaphor for repetitive content, "can turn against you." What should affirm becomes disturbing, what should please becomes traumatic. The loops that usually provide comfort can trap us in unwanted repetition, forced watching, compulsive return.</p>

            <summary class="section-toggle">4.4 The Subtweet: Hidden Messages in Plain Sight</summary>
            <div class="section-content">
                <p>One of the most fascinating forms of phone-mediated communication discussed in <em>Shadowbook</em> is the subtweet—a message that appears public but contains a hidden meaning for a specific person. "The subtweet is like a literary manifestation of sublimation on Twitter, where 'literary' is meant as: double-edged, ambiguous, complex."</p>
                
                <p>The author describes how sharing song lyrics, book quotes, or cryptic observations becomes a way of communicating to one person while maintaining plausible deniability to everyone else. "All in the hope that the other is able to decipher the message. Whether they can, is the uncertainty that comes with cover."</p>
                
                <p>This is contemporary courtship, contemporary connection. We perform our feelings in public spaces, hoping the intended recipient will notice while others scroll past unaware. The phone enables this kind of steganography—hiding messages in plain sight. "It's encryption in public."</p>
                
                <p><em>Shadowbook</em> explores the subtweet extensively: "When it comes to the subtweet this hidden meaning is mostly negative, because, let's be honest, the subtweet usually hits below the belt, is directed at someone who's on the receiving end, someone who's being set back."</p>
                
                <p>But the essay reframes this: "The subtweet as an act of love. It can happen." The subtweet becomes a way of reaching across distance, of making connection while protecting oneself from the vulnerability of direct communication. "I talk to him without talking to him and pray that he hears what I say."</p>
                
                <p>The phone makes the subtweet possible. It provides the public platform where the message is posted, the private interpretation where it's received, the ambiguity that allows both public and private meaning to coexist. The subtweet is a distinctly phone-enabled form of communication, impossible without social media platforms accessed primarily through mobile devices.</p>
                
                <p>"The subtweet stands in a tradition of secrecy, of stealthy signs and meaningful glances and everything that has to do with seduction and desire, with daydreaming and flirting. It stands in a romantic tradition of one-way traffic that is not so much out to get an answer — although, sure, yes, please — but would give an arm just to be heard and understood."</p>

        <details class="section">
            <summary class="section-toggle">4.5 Social Steganography</summary>
            <div class="section-content">
                <p>Beyond the subtweet, <em>Shadowbook</em> discusses "social steganography"—the practice of hiding messages in plain sight, particularly common among teenagers but increasingly widespread. "Teenagers who share YouTube videos with covert messages that others, parents or teachers, don't understand. Me sharing book covers and photos of pages, quotes and blurbs."</p>
                
                <p>This practice reveals something essential about phone-mediated communication: its simultaneous publicity and privacy. Everything we post is potentially visible to everyone, yet we manage to encode messages that only specific people will understand. The phone hosts both the public performance and the private signal.</p>
                
                <p>"Instead of keeping a secret, the secret is hidden in plain sight, packed up in an update and posted for everyone to see." This is a distinctly contemporary form of secrecy, one adapted to an environment of constant visibility. We can't hide, so we hide in the open, using codes and references and in-jokes that create islands of privacy within public spaces.</p>
                
                <p>The phone enables this through its multimedia capabilities. We share songs that mean something specific to someone who will recognize them. We post photos that contain hidden significance. We use emoji combinations that function as code. The phone's richness of communication channels—text, image, video, audio, link—provides multiple layers where meaning can be encrypted.</p>
                
                <p>"Not everyone understands the post, thank heavens, they're not supposed to! Whether it's a song, a poem, a witticism or a phrase, they don't know that they don't understand, that they miss out on something. It's always also just a song, poem, witticism or phrase."</p>
                
                <p>This double-coding, this ability to mean one thing to most people and something else to the intended recipient, transforms the phone from a broadcasting device into a device for secret communication in public. It's a modern version of the Renaissance practice of sending coded love letters that would pass through multiple hands before reaching their destination, each handler seeing only an innocent message while the intended recipient reads the hidden meaning.</p>
                
                <p>The phone makes this practice ubiquitous. Every post potentially contains layers of meaning, references known only to small groups or pairs. This creates networks of understanding that crosscut the apparent networks of followers and friends. You might have thousands of followers, but only one person will understand what you really meant by that particular quote.</p>
