            <div class="section-content">
                <p>Though not explicitly focused on death, <em>Shadowbook</em> returns repeatedly to mortality, to endings, to loss. The phone plays a complex role in how we relate to death in contemporary life.</p>
                
                <p>The "Shadowbook" piece includes this reflection: "Who I was when he died: 25, a student, afraid of death. Who I am now: A woman who doesn't want to tell you her age, project manager, indifferent. Death leaves me indifferent (cold). Death leaves me cold. Death is the end, that's all."</p>
                
                <p>The phone archives the dead. Our contacts lists contain names of people no longer living. Our photo rolls include their faces. Their messages remain in our inboxes, preserved indefinitely. The phone makes the dead present in ways that were impossible before—we can scroll through their words, their images, their digital traces.</p>
                
                <p>This can be comforting—the dead remain accessible, present, not entirely gone. But it can also be disturbing. The phone doesn't know who's dead and who's alive. It offers to auto-complete texts to the deceased, suggests reconnecting with them on social media, includes them in photo memories.</p>

        <!-- COLLAPSIBLE SECTION 11.2 -->
        <details class="section">
            <summary class="section-toggle">11.2 Digital Ghosts</summary>
            <div class="section-content">
                <p>"I dream of the dead. Grandpa, my father, Bamse. They are the living dead, for real. Zombie is an unpleasant word, whoever would take it seriously? Still, they are zombies, the dead in my dreams."</p>
                
                <p>The phone is haunted by digital ghosts—the persistent presence of the no-longer-present. Social media profiles of the deceased remain active, becoming memorials or just strange frozen moments. Their last posts stay up, forever their most recent activity.</p>
                
                <p>This creates an uncanny relationship to death. The dead persist in digital form, continuing to exist in our feeds, our contacts, our memories in ways that blur the boundary between presence and absence, life and death.</p>
                
                <p>"The joy of seeing them, the dead, is reserved, unpleasing. Shouldn't it be pleasant to embrace or stroke the dead in your dreams? It should. But my embrace is careful, so as not to feel the cold and not to break them."</p>
                
                <p>The phone's archive is like this careful embrace—we can access the dead without fully confronting their deadness. We can look at photos without touching cold flesh, read messages without hearing the silence of no response.</p>

        <details class="section">
            <summary class="section-toggle">11.3 The Archive of Loss</summary>
            <div class="section-content">
                <p>The phone creates what we might call an archive of loss. Every ended relationship, every lost friend, every person who's grown distant remains documented in message histories, tagged photos, shared posts. The phone remembers what we might prefer to forget.</p>
                
                <p>This makes moving on difficult. After a breakup, the phone contains years of messages, photos, evidence of intimacy that once existed. You can delete it all, but the knowledge that it was there remains. The phone has witnessed your life, and it remembers.</p>
                
                <p>Old messages from people we no longer speak to, photos from happier times, evidence of who we used to be. The phone remembers everything we might prefer to forget, makes the past always present and accessible.</p>
                
                <p>This permanent archive changes how we experience endings. Nothing fully ends when it's preserved digitally. The relationship that's over continues to exist in the phone's memory, accessible with a few taps. The person who's left your life remains present in your device.</p>

        <!-- COLLAPSIBLE SECTION 11.4 -->
        <details class="section">
            <summary class="section-toggle">11.4 Passive Longing for Death</summary>
            <div class="section-content">
                <p>The "Shadowbook" piece contains dark reflections: "I know of a 'passive longing for death' also known as 'a theoretical interest' in it — you don't really want to die, you definitely won't go through any trouble in order to die, but you can sometimes long for it passively."</p>
                
                <p>The phone can intensify this passive death wish. It makes visible all the ways we don't measure up, all the people having better lives, all the experiences we're missing. The constant comparison, the metrics of inadequacy, the evidence of exclusion—all can contribute to a desire to escape, to end, to stop.</p>
                
                <p>But the phone also connects us to reasons to live. It's how we maintain relationships, find community, access help. Crisis hotlines are just a text away. Support groups gather in forums. The phone can save lives even as it sometimes makes life feel unbearable.</p>
                
                <p>"Every living creature in this world dies alone. Repeat X times."</p>
                
                <p>The phone seems to promise we won't die alone—we're always connected, always reachable. But it also ensures a kind of loneliness—the loneliness of being always visible but never fully seen, always connected but never fully met.</p>

        <!-- COLLAPSIBLE SECTION 11.5 -->
        <details class="section">
            <summary class="section-toggle">11.5 What Remains</summary>
            <div class="section-content">
                <p>After we die, our phones remain. They become artifacts, archives, evidence of a life. They contain our final messages, our last photos, our recent searches. They become intensely private objects that someone must access, must go through, must decide what to do with.</p>
                
                <p>This gives the phone a peculiar status—it's the most complete record of a contemporary life, more intimate than diaries, more comprehensive than photo albums. But it's locked, encrypted, protected. Accessing it requires passwords, knowledge of security questions, sometimes legal authorization.</p>
                
                <p>The phone becomes a question: what do we leave behind in digital form? How much of our lives exists only in devices that will eventually die, be wiped, be replaced? The phone archives us, but it's a fragile archive, dependent on power, on companies, on platforms that may not persist.</p>
