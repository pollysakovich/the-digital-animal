            <summary class="section-toggle">5.1 The Earworm and the Gif</summary>
            <div class="section-content">
                <p><em>Shadowbook</em> makes a compelling connection between two forms of repetition that characterize phone use: the earworm (a song stuck in your head) and the gif (an endlessly looping image). "The earworm, that repetitive form, is the soundtrack of the dome," the author writes. It's a song that plays again and again, accompanying your movements through the day, becoming inseparable from particular feelings or periods of your life. The phone is often the source of these earworms—we stream music constantly, creating personal soundtracks that loop and repeat.</p>
                
                <p>The essay describes how "the song accompanies you; it is the first thing you hear after the alarm, the first thing you say, sing, to start the day. The song says it all, even if it's just like screams on a scale (those are the best)."</p>
                
                <p>The earworm isn't random—it's often connected to emotional states, to the person you're thinking about, to the dome of attention you're performing within. The phone delivers the song, yes, but it also becomes associated with the song, holds the song, makes it available for the repetitive listening that turns it into an earworm.</p>
                
                <p>Similarly, the gif is described as "of an open and patient nature, since it has no end point but just keeps moving on." We watch gifs loop repeatedly, finding something new in each repetition. "It doesn't offer something new but something more. Like when you stroll through a museum and instead of granting each work just a couple seconds' glance you sit down and give yourself and the work the chance for more."</p>
                
                <p>The phone encourages this kind of repetitive attention. We scroll through the same feeds multiple times a day, check the same apps in sequence, repeat our patterns of use. This repetition isn't meaningless—it's how we find meaning, how we extract more from the same content, how we structure our days.</p>
                
                <p><em>Shadowbook</em> develops the gif metaphor extensively: "The gif, moving as it is, all the while catching and fulfilling needy attention spans, has that exact complicity built in." The gif is designed for the phone, for the kind of attention phones enable—brief, looping, capable of being watched multiple times in succession.</p>
                
                <p>"The eye, the camera, makes you move in repetitive ways. Someone's watching and that someone wants to watch. So you give him something more to watch. It's a very nuanced movement you make, filled with meaning and significance that gets hinted at but isn't very clearly articulated in itself."</p>
                
                <p>We become gifs ourselves, repeating movements, gestures, expressions that we know photograph well or video well. We learn our angles, our poses, our ways of presenting that work on the phone's screen. The phone trains us in these repetitions.</p>

            <summary class="section-toggle">5.2 The Morning Ritual</summary>
            <div class="section-content">
                <p>Many people describe similar morning rituals with their phones: the alarm sounds, we silence it, then immediately begin scrolling. Email, news, social media, messages—we check each in turn, often in the same order every day.</p>
                
                <p>This ritual serves multiple functions. It orients us to the world, tells us what happened while we slept, reconnects us to our social networks. But it's also a form of comfort, of continuity. The phone is the first thing we touch, the first voice we hear (even if it's just notification chimes), the first window we look through.</p>
                
                <p><em>Shadowbook</em> captures this: "everything starts with a morning routine—the song accompanies you; it is the first thing you hear after the alarm, the first thing you say, sing, to start the day."</p>
                
                <p>The phone has inserted itself into the most intimate moments of our daily rhythms. It's there when we wake and when we sleep, present in our most private spaces. It knows our patterns better than we do ourselves. The phone tracks our sleep, knows when we typically wake, adjusts its behavior to our routines.</p>
                
                <p>This morning ritual has been much criticized as preventing presence, as immediately fragmenting attention rather than allowing a peaceful awakening. But we might also see it as a contemporary form of morning prayer or meditation—a way of connecting to something larger than ourselves, of situating ourselves within networks of meaning and relationship.</p>
                
                <p>The repetitiveness of the ritual matters. We do the same thing every morning because that consistency provides structure, creates a known beginning to each day. The phone enables this ritual, hosts it, makes it possible through its reliability and consistency. It's always there, always ready, always containing the same apps in the same configuration.</p>
                
                <p>Some people resist the morning phone ritual, deliberately keeping phones out of bedrooms or waiting to check them until after other morning activities. This resistance itself reveals the phone's power—we feel we must actively defend against it, create rules and boundaries to prevent it from colonizing our mornings completely.</p>

            <summary class="section-toggle">5.3 Scrolling as Meditation</summary>
            <div class="section-content">
                <p>The repetitive action of scrolling has become one of the defining gestures of contemporary life. Thumb moving upward, content flowing down, an endless stream of information, images, text. We can scroll for hours, barely registering what we're seeing, the action becoming almost automatic.</p>
                
                <p>This has been widely criticized as attention-destroying distraction, but we might also see it as a kind of meditation—not mindfulness exactly, but a state of consciousness that's neither fully present nor entirely absent. When we scroll, we're nowhere and everywhere, taking in information without necessarily processing it deeply, existing in a liminal state between engagement and disconnection.</p>
                
                <p>The phone facilitates this state. Its interface is designed for scrolling, for the easy movement of content past our eyes. Infinite scroll means there's always more, no natural stopping point, no end. The phone keeps us in this meditative-but-not-meditative state, suspended in its endless feed.</p>
                
                <p><em>Shadowbook</em> doesn't explicitly discuss scrolling, but the essay on repetition and the gif captures something of its quality: "You've never watched quite enough, you've never grasped them fully; they always seem to contain something new." The same is true of scrolling—there's always something we might have missed, always the possibility of seeing something that matters, that's meant for us.</p>
                
                <p>Scrolling creates its own temporality. Clock time continues, but scrolling time is different—elastic, non-linear, sometimes seeming to pass quickly and sometimes slowly. We look up from scrolling to discover that hours have passed, or that only minutes have elapsed though it felt like longer. The phone creates a time-pocket we fall into.</p>
                
                <p>The repetitiveness of scrolling—seeing the same types of posts over and over, even if not the exact same posts—creates a strange sense of stasis. Everything is new but nothing changes. The feed refreshes constantly but maintains the same character. We scroll hoping for something different while finding comfort in the sameness.</p>

        <details class="section">
            <summary class="section-toggle">5.4 The Compulsion to Check</summary>
            <div class="section-content">
                <p>Related to scrolling is the compulsion to check—to look at the phone frequently throughout the day, often without specific purpose. We check it when we're bored, when we're anxious, when we're waiting, when we have a free moment, when we don't know what else to do.</p>
                
                <p>This checking is ritualistic, almost tic-like. We know we checked it five minutes ago, that nothing important has happened in the interval, yet we check again. The phone has trained us in this behavior through intermittent reinforcement—most checks yield nothing, but occasionally there's something interesting, and that occasional reward keeps us checking.</p>
                
                <p><em>Shadowbook</em> captures this compulsive quality in the fragmented "Shadowbook" piece, which reads like status updates checking in on consciousness throughout the day: "3 hrs," "5 hrs," "8 hrs," "Now," "Yesterday at 6:45 am," "Yesterday at 11:44 pm." The timestamps suggest constant monitoring, continuous checking, a life measured in notifications and updates.</p>
                
                <p>The compulsion to check reveals the phone's hold on our attention. We're not freely choosing to check—we're responding to a trained impulse, a habit so ingrained it's become automatic. The phone has become an itch we must scratch, a hunger we must feed, a voice we must answer.</p>
                
                <p>Various apps now track phone use, showing us how many times we unlocked it, how many hours we spent on it, which apps consumed our time. These metrics are meant to help us reduce use, but they often just add another thing to check, another metric to obsess over. The phone monitors our monitoring.</p>

        <details class="section">
            <summary class="section-toggle">5.5 Notification Culture</summary>
            <div class="section-content">
                <p>Notifications are the phone's way of demanding attention. They interrupt whatever we're doing to announce that something has happened: a message arrived, someone liked a post, an app wants to tell us something. Each notification is a little hook, pulling us back to the phone.</p>
                
                <p>We've developed complex relationships with notifications. Some people turn them all off, finding them too intrusive. Others carefully curate which apps can notify, creating a hierarchy of importance. Still others leave everything on, constantly interrupted by bleeps and buzzes and banners.</p>
                
                <p>Notifications create what might be called a state of continuous partial attention. We're never fully focused on anything because we're always partly attending to the phone, waiting for the next notification, wondering if something important has arrived. This fragmentation of attention has been extensively criticized and studied.</p>
                
                <p>But notifications also serve important functions. They keep us connected to others, alert us to urgent matters, create a sense of being plugged into flows of information and social life. The notification is the phone's way of saying "you matter, someone is trying to reach you, something is happening that involves you."</p>
                
                <p><em>Shadowbook</em> doesn't explicitly discuss notifications, but the dome metaphor captures their affective quality. Each notification is a confirmation that someone is watching, that we exist in others' awareness, that the dome is intact. The anxiety we feel when notifications stop—why isn't anyone messaging? has something happened?—reveals how much we've come to depend on this continuous confirmation of existence.</p>
