            <div class="section-content">
                <p><em>Shadowbook</em> includes a long meditation on friendship in the smartphone age: "40: A Fictitious Smartphone Essay on Friendship." The title itself signals the form—a piece meant to be read on a phone, fragmented and scrollable, addressing themes relevant to phone-mediated relationships.</p>
                
                <p>The essay asks: "At what point do you call someone a friend?" and proposes a demarcation criterion: "You treat as a friend those who are allowed to ring your doorbell in the middle of the night."</p>
                
                <p>But in the age of phones, this criterion becomes complicated. Anyone in your contacts can reach you at any time. The phone abolishes the doorbell—or rather, makes every notification a doorbell that anyone might ring. We've lost the physical boundaries that once defined different levels of intimacy.</p>
                
                <p>The essay explores this through personal reflection: "I've counted them. They amount to forty, rounded up. Of this forty there are five who I am sure would count me, if they counted. Of the other thirty-five there must be ten who would at least consider me. The rest I consider to be my collection of personal favorites."</p>
                
                <p>This quantification of friendship—making a spreadsheet of one's social life—is both humorous and painful. The phone makes these calculations visible, forces us to confront the mathematics of relationship. Who responds to your messages? Who likes your posts? Who initiates contact? The phone tracks all of this, creating an implicit ranking even when we resist explicit counting.</p>
                
                <p>"If I try to reverse this scenario, I begin to doubt; whose doorbell would I dare to ring? The demarcation criterion isn't reversible either."</p>
                
                <p>Friendship involves asymmetry—the people who would answer our midnight calls may not be the people whose midnight calls we'd answer. The phone makes this asymmetry visible and quantifiable in ways that can be uncomfortable.</p>

        <details class="section">
            <summary class="section-toggle">9.2 The School Yard and the Feed</summary>
            <div class="section-content">
                <p>The essay nostalgically recalls the school yard as a space where friendships naturally formed through proximity and shared time: "Four, five years on a couple of square kilometers: nothing could break us up, except, again, the disappearance of those two conditions that make friendship easy or even possible; we could be broken up once space and time were broken up themselves."</p>
                
                <p>The school yard provided what friendship needs: regular co-presence, shared experience, accumulated history. You saw the same people daily, developed in-jokes, built trust through repeated interaction. The physical space created a container for friendship, and shared time deposited layers of connection like sediment.</p>
                
                <p>The phone is presented as both destroyer and replacement of the school yard. It breaks up shared physical space—we're no longer gathered in one place—but creates a new kind of shared space: "My smartphone is in my hand. It is a space shared with dozens of people, or whatever you want to call them. It is a school yard, panopticon, fence, hangout, campus, city center, house. A kitchen table."</p>
                
                <p>This passage captures the phone's transformative effect on friendship. The social media feed becomes the new school yard, a place where we gather daily, where we see and are seen, where friendships form and fray. But it's a school yard that follows us everywhere, that never closes, that contains not just our immediate peers but potentially everyone.</p>
                
                <p>The essay describes the old school yard in loving detail: "That was probably because you didn't have to put a lot of work in it. Each day you arrived at the school yard, parked your bike, and there they were. It must have been the opposite sensation for those kids who were bullied. My god, there they are, again. Each day I was relieved, again. Sweet Jesus, thank god, there they are."</p>
                
                <p>This reliability, this guaranteed presence, is what phones promise but don't quite deliver. Yes, our friends are always accessible through our phones, but they're also always absent, always elsewhere, always potentially ignoring us. The phone creates constant availability without guaranteed presence.</p>
                
                <p>"Proximity won't let friendships bloom automatically, just like proximity isn't a guarantee for or against rivalry. The school yard has a bad reputation: as soon as there's a case of gossiping, bullying or group forming, like in a work situation or a neighborhood, you can be dead certain that someone will start to mumble that 'it's just like in the school yard'."</p>
                
                <p>The phone amplifies both the positive and negative aspects of school yard dynamics. It enables connection across distance, but also enables gossip, bullying, exclusion. The same features that make friendship possible make cruelty possible. The phone is neutral infrastructure that can host either warmth or coldness, connection or rejection.</p>

        <!-- COLLAPSIBLE SECTION 9.3 -->
        <details class="section">
            <summary class="section-toggle">9.3 Space and Time Collapsed</summary>
            <div class="section-content">
                <p>One of the essay's key insights is how phones transform the spatial and temporal conditions of friendship. Traditional friendship required shared space and shared time—you had to be in the same place at the same time, repeatedly, for friendship to develop.</p>
                
                <p>"A shared space and a shared time: both are essential, but sometimes you can hardly tell them apart. There was always a tomorrow when we met in the school yard. Time went by without you noticing it and left some kind of residue behind. Layer after layer a ground grew beneath our feet, a shared ground."</p>
                
                <p>The phone seems to eliminate spatial constraints—you can be friends with people anywhere in the world. But it also changes time, making it both more available (you can message anytime) and more fractured (everyone's on their own schedule, responding when they can or want to).</p>
                
                <p>The essay captures this with the image of the ground beneath one's feet: "The school yard, one might say, was duration turned tangible, right beneath our feet." When we move away from that shared ground, what happens? "I couldn't bring the floor of that house wherever I went, like the school yard beneath my feet. It wasn't my house."</p>
                
                <p>The phone tries to be portable ground, a floor we can carry with us. And in some ways it succeeds—our contacts, our messages, our shared history are always with us. But it's a different kind of ground, less solid, more ephemeral. The residue of time doesn't accumulate in quite the same way.</p>
                
                <p>"I haven't lived in that little town for quite some time now, with the one school on the one side and the other on the other and the two primary schools in the middle. Most of my class mates left too. They still live just around the corner, basically. But even though we moved to the same city, we couldn't take the ground beneath our feet — the duration turned tangible with us."</p>
                
                <p>This poignantly captures what's lost when shared physical space disappears. Even when people live near each other, without a regular gathering place, without routine co-presence, the ground of friendship erodes. The phone can't quite replace it, though it tries.</p>
                
                <p>The essay argues against theorists who claim social media are "non-places"—spaces without identity or history. Instead, it insists that these phone-mediated spaces are real places, that they have character and memory, that friendships formed there are genuine friendships. "Moreover, they are places where we spend a lot of time. Hours and hours each day, week, month, year. Not only do we share the space, those recognizable, designated, shared places — all the people hanging out there are in our proximity and the residue this shared time leaves is just as real as the residue beneath our feet, coming down on the school yard."</p>

        <!-- COLLAPSIBLE SECTION 9.4 -->
        <details class="section">
            <summary class="section-toggle">9.4 The Terror of Presence</summary>
            <div class="section-content">
                <p>The essay discusses "the terror of presence"—the way phones make us constantly available, constantly visible, constantly accountable. "I'm absent. My chat function is turned off by default. My response time lies well over five seconds. I read everything, but the degree of my interactivity is unpredictable. I won't let myself be pushed about."</p>
                
                <p>This is resistance to the phone's demand for constant availability. Friendship mediated by phones comes with the expectation of rapid response, of being always on, of maintaining constant contact. This can feel like pressure, like surveillance, like an obligation that never ends.</p>
                
                <p>"Now I hardly get any messages at all. Sometimes I take a tour of the networks, leaving a trace of hearts and smileys, so as to return to myself the glow of presence. It's like I'm trying to make an energy saving bulb light up using a bike, I can see a shimmer of light in the distance, but my legs always get tired first."</p>
                
                <p>The phone creates a catch-22: if you're constantly available, you feel overwhelmed; if you're not available, you become invisible, forgotten. There's no easy balance between presence and absence, between connection and autonomy.</p>
                
                <p>The essay also notes how phones make visible what we're excluded from: "Worst of all is demotion. You've been hidden, muted, ignored, given the silent treatment, like could happen in the school yard. Unlike was the case there, online there's no one to notice. Demotion is invisible."</p>
                
                <p>This captures something painful about phone-mediated friendship—you can be excluded without knowing it, muted or blocked or algorithmically deprioritized. The school yard at least made exclusion visible; you could see when you weren't invited, when groups formed without you. The phone hides these dynamics, making them feel more personal, more like individual failure.</p>
                
                <p>The essay includes a provocative observation about status updates: "I've heard say that 'there is status updates, but no friendship updates.' I didn't immediately understand whether it referred to status updates put on Facebook or updates in your actual status — your salary and your prestige and everything that tags along."</p>
                
                <p>This double meaning reveals something about phone-mediated friendship: the status we perform online and the actual status that shapes our lives are interconnected. When our circumstances change, our social networks reconfigure around us. The phone makes this visible in painful ways. "In this violence of the masses the old friendships are rendered invisible, they will always succumb to those with greater status." The algorithms prioritize popular accounts, accounts that match our recent behavior, accounts that generate engagement. Old friends simply disappear from view.</p>
                
                <p>"You're parading alright, but only in front of the mirror and behind the mirror there is no-one left." This image captures the isolation that can occur even while connected. You post to social media, perform your life for an imagined audience, but no one may actually be watching. The phone promises connection but can deliver loneliness.</p>

        <!-- COLLAPSIBLE SECTION 9.5 -->
        <details class="section">
            <summary class="section-toggle">9.5 Friendship as Destruction</summary>
            <div class="section-content">
                <p>A recurring image in the essay is the kitchen table—the site of traditional family conversation, of gathered presence, of unhurried talk. The phone is accused of destroying this: "The kitchen table of the nuclear family is the unity of friendliness, that's how it goes nowadays."</p>
                
                <p>But the essay complicates this nostalgia: "I try to remember conversations I supposedly had before and now miss out on. I had the school yard, the city center, for a short while I even had a local hangout, and the friend-of-the-house-house. There was talking and eating, drinking, dancing and kissing. There were jokes being made: word jokes, bad jokes, inside jokes. What conversations were left behind there, which got lost?"</p>
                
                <p>The answer: "I can't remember and I don't have to. It is a well-known fact that the conversation we are mourning over is the conversation at the kitchen table, where everyone tells how their day went, one by one. A stringent, although not necessarily wide-spread norm, the holy norm of the higher middle class, a WASP-like utopia born in the nuclear family."</p>
                
                <p>This punctures the nostalgia for pre-phone conversation. The idealized kitchen table conversation wasn't universal, wasn't necessarily better, wasn't the standard against which phone conversation should be judged. The phone enables different forms of conversation, not necessarily inferior ones.</p>
                
                <p>The essay ends with a dark insight: "In the end friendship isn't a product, it's destruction. A self igniting friendship bomb. The crack in the seamless, happy, content, familiar, is where true friendship reveals itself, but then boom! it goes up in the air."</p>
                
                <p>This suggests that real friendship involves risk, involves vulnerability, involves the possibility of harm. The phone both enables and threatens this kind of friendship. It makes connection easier but also makes rejection more visible, more painful, more permanent.</p>
                
                <p>The essay recalls a moment with Josh: "I was convinced you were the love of my life.' He said: 'Same. Me too.' Here's a slogan for friendship for you: 'A woman and a men being lovers is a friendship-bomb.' I let the bomb explode in his face."</p>
                
                <p>The phone enables these explosions. It makes confession possible—you can text things you'd never say in person—but it also records them permanently, makes them irrevocable. The phone is infrastructure for intensity, for the kind of friendship that's also destruction.</p>
