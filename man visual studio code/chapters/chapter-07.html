            <div class="section-content">
                <p><em>Shadowbook</em> includes an essay titled "The Post-digital Condition" that explores what happens when digital technologies become so ubiquitous that they're no longer noticed as digital. "'Post digital' doesn't mean that the digital era is behind us. The concept heralds a new phase wherein the digital has become self-evident, hardly distinct from the 'non-digital.'"</p>
                
                <p>The phone is the perfect emblem of this condition. We no longer think of it as a piece of digital technology—it's just "my phone," as natural and unremarkable as our shoes or our keys. The digital has been domesticated, naturalized, made into something we don't see as artificial.</p>
                
                <p>This has profound implications for how we understand ourselves. If the digital is natural, then our digitally-mediated experiences are as "real" as any other experiences. The connections we make through phones aren't virtual substitutes for real connection—they're just connection, full stop.</p>
                
                <p>The essay traces the concept's origins: "'Post-digital' was coined as a term in the year 2000 by Kim Cascone in an article on electronic music. Now it is used in the visual arts especially; the possible literary meaning of the term is undefined as of yet."</p>
                
                <p>Rasch proposes extending the concept to literature and to existence itself: "What could the post digital mean in a literary context? Could it be interpreted even as something existential, just as 'the post-digital condition' suggests? I think so. Digitization not only has an impact on media, art and design but also on people."</p>
                
                <p>The phone is where the post-digital becomes existential. It's not just a tool we use; it's become part of how we exist, how we experience the world, how we relate to others and to ourselves. The phone has changed what it means to be human in the early twenty-first century.</p>

            <summary class="section-toggle">7.2 The Atomized Individual</summary>
            <div class="section-content">
                <p>The essay discusses how digitization has extended beyond devices to people themselves: "A man or a woman is also, presumably, analogue... Today this is becoming less and less evident, however. The whole world has been put in a digital framework, in other words, everything has become split up and 'atomized' into pieces, is regarded as countable."</p>
                
                <p>The phone is both instrument and symbol of this atomization. It quantifies everything: steps taken, calories burned, hours slept, messages sent, likes received. It breaks us down into data points that can be measured, compared, optimized. We become dashboards displaying metrics of our own lives.</p>
                
                <p>This quantification extends into realms traditionally considered resistant to measurement. How happy are you on a scale of 1-10? Rate your sleep quality. Track your moods. Log your meals. The phone makes all this trackable, creating vast personal datasets that supposedly help us understand ourselves better.</p>
                
                <p>But <em>Shadowbook</em> suggests we long for something beyond quantification: "The hunger for a factual reality has changed into a new hunger or even nostalgia, for something that is lost to data, a realness that goes beyond all categorization and counting digits."</p>
                
                <p>This "realness" is what the phone simultaneously enables and threatens. The phone connects us to subjective experience—to feelings, to relationships, to meaning. But it also constantly tries to quantify these experiences, to turn them into data, to make them measurable and comparable.</p>
                
                <p>The tension between these impulses—toward quantification and toward realness—characterizes much of contemporary phone use. We want to track ourselves and we want to escape tracking. We want to be seen and we want privacy. We want connection and we want solitude. The phone is the site where these contradictions play out.</p>

            <summary class="section-toggle">7.3 Realness in a Mediated World</summary>
            <div class="section-content">
                <p>If everything is mediated by phones and screens, if our experiences are increasingly digital, where do we find what the essay calls "realness"? The answer offered is surprising: in subjective experience, in feeling, in what can't be quantified.</p>
                
                <p>"Realness is beyond all doubt," the author writes, quoting David Shields. In a world where facts are contested and reality seems increasingly arbitrary, our own experiences become the only reliable ground. The phone mediates these experiences, but it doesn't make them less real.</p>
                
                <p>The essay discusses how "reality hunger"—the desire for something authentic in an increasingly mediated world—manifests in contemporary literature. Writers like Karl Ove Knausgård and Sheila Heti blur the boundaries between fiction and autobiography, between made-up and real, creating works that refuse traditional categories.</p>
                
                <p>This suggests a different way of understanding our relationship with phones. They're not making us less real, less human, less present. Instead, they're becoming part of how we experience realness, how we confirm our existence to ourselves and others. The phone has become integrated into the very texture of contemporary experience.</p>
                
                <p><em>Shadowbook</em> explores this through its own form. The essays experiment with different modes of writing that acknowledge and incorporate digital mediation. "A Small Organic Banana" uses numbered fragments like a listicle. "Shadowbook" reads like status updates. "40: A Fictitious Smartphone Essay on Friendship" is explicitly designed to be read on a phone. "SUBLIMINALITATIONS" originated as voice recordings on a phone.</p>
                
                <p>These formal experiments suggest that writing through the digital doesn't mean abandoning depth or meaning. It means finding new forms adequate to new modes of experience, forms that acknowledge mediation while still reaching toward realness, toward authentic expression of subjective experience.</p>

        <details class="section">
            <summary class="section-toggle">7.4 The Communal and the Individual</summary>
            <div class="section-content">
                <p>The essay on the post-digital condition explores how contemporary life involves constant negotiation between individual and communal experience. The phone is central to this negotiation—it connects us to communities while also isolating us, makes us part of larger collectives while also fragmenting us into individual users.</p>
                
                <p><em>Shadowbook</em> discusses Karl Ove Knausgård's concept of "the communal"—domains like art, language, and history that are shared, that shape individuals while being shaped by them. "These domains are not quantifiable, they are heterogeneous. They can only be experienced individually and shared subjectively."</p>
                
                <p>The phone mediates access to these communal domains. Through it, we engage with art, participate in language evolution, connect to history. But the phone also individualizes this engagement—each of us has our own feed, our own algorithm, our own filter bubble. The communal becomes fragmented into millions of individual experiences.</p>
                
                <p>This creates tension: "In the post-digital world, the hunger for factual reality has changed into a new hunger or even nostalgia, for something that is lost to data, a realness that goes beyond all categorization and counting digits."</p>
                
                <p>The phone promises to connect us to the communal while actually often isolating us in our individual experiences. We're all looking at screens, but we're each seeing something different. The shared experience of mass media has been replaced by the fragmented experience of personalized feeds.</p>
                
                <p>Yet the essay suggests that genuine connection remains possible: "We don't know the effects we have on each other, but we have them." The phone, despite its individualizing tendencies, still enables real connection, real community, real shared experience. The challenge is recognizing and cultivating these possibilities amid the noise and fragmentation.</p>
