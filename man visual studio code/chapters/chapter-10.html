            <div class="section-content">
                <p>The final piece in <em>Shadowbook</em> is "SUBLIMINALITATIONS," which originated not as written text but as voice recordings on a phone. This represents a shift from text-based to voice-based phone use, from writing to speaking.</p>
                
                <p>"The last essay, just as fictitious or real as the others, in a way is a goodbye to the question. The thousands of words of 'SUBLIMINALITATIONS' are written down, but they came into being in my lungs, through the throat, on my tongue, as I spoke into my phone's recording app."</p>
                
                <p>This shift is significant. The phone began as a device for speaking—it was called a telephone, after all—but smartphone use has been dominated by text, by writing and reading rather than speaking and listening. Voice messages, voice notes, podcasts, and audiobooks represent a return to the phone's vocal origins.</p>
                
                <p>"Ideally silence would be maintained, but in a different way. I imagine someone sitting on a train with their headphones on, looking out the window but with an inward gaze, retreated into an inner silence on the cadence of the words, the voice."</p>
                
                <p>This describes a different mode of phone use—contemplative, receptive, focused on listening rather than constant interaction. The voice recording creates intimacy different from text—you hear breath, pauses, intonation, the grain of the voice. You access something of the body, the presence, the aliveness of the speaker.</p>

        <!-- COLLAPSIBLE SECTION 10.2 -->
        <details class="section">
            <summary class="section-toggle">10.2 The Dictaphone Function</summary>
            <div class="section-content">
                <p>"SUBLIMINALITATIONS" begins: "Hey you, it's me. I want... to let... you know... I don't really want to talk, nonetheless I'll try to speak to you, because it'll be a way to transubstantiate you through the dictaphone function of my iPhone."</p>
                
                <p>The phone's recording function transforms monologue into dialogue, creates an imagined listener, makes speaking to oneself into speaking to another. This "transubstantiation"—the transformation of one substance into another—suggests something almost religious about phone-mediated communication.</p>
                
                <p>Speaking into the phone creates a feedback loop different from writing: "There's no one on the other end, I know. I'm just creating a feedback loop, out of my mouth and into the phone and from the phone back into my own ear."</p>
                
                <p>The phone as mirror, as echo chamber, as device that reflects ourselves back to us. But also as mediator that changes what it reflects, adds delay, adds the sense of being overheard, creates distance even as it enables intimacy.</p>

        <!-- COLLAPSIBLE SECTION 10.3 -->
        <details class="section">
            <summary class="section-toggle">10.3 The Voice Note</summary>
            <div class="section-content">
                <p>Voice notes or voice messages have become increasingly common, enabled by messaging apps that make recording and sending as easy as typing. The voice note occupies an interesting space between the phone call (synchronous, demanding immediate attention) and the text message (asynchronous, readable when convenient).</p>
                
                <p>Voice notes carry more information than text—tone, emotion, emphasis—but they're also more demanding. You can skim text, but voice requires linear listening at a fixed pace. Voice notes can feel either intimate (this person trusts me with their voice) or intrusive (now I have to listen to this).</p>
                
                <p><em>Shadowbook</em> doesn't explicitly discuss voice notes, but "SUBLIMINALITATIONS" operates in their register. It's spoken directly to a "you," but that you is imagined, not present. It's intimate but one-sided, personal but performed.</p>
                
                <p>The essay reflects on this: "The you I'm talking to is the one who lives inside my head and occasionally stretches out into my whole body, making my fingers tingle, weakening my knees and filling up my lungs with heavy, delicious floods of air."</p>
                
                <p>Speaking into the phone creates an imagined intimacy, a sense of direct address even when no one is listening. The phone becomes a confessional booth, a therapist's couch, a friend's ear—all roles it plays by being a recording device that receives voice without judgment or interruption.</p>

        <!-- COLLAPSIBLE SECTION 10.4 -->
        <details class="section">
            <summary class="section-toggle">10.4 Podcasts and Audiobooks</summary>
            <div class="section-content">
                <p>The phone has revived oral culture through podcasts and audiobooks. We listen to voices speaking to us for hours, developing parasocial relationships with hosts and authors, feeling like we know them through the intimacy of their voices in our ears.</p>
                
                <p>This represents a return to pre-literate modes of transmission—stories told aloud, knowledge passed through speech. But it's mediated through the most advanced technology, through devices that make any voice accessible anywhere anytime.</p>
                
                <p>The phone makes us listeners again. We listen while doing other things—commuting, exercising, cleaning—creating a doubled attention where part of the mind is engaged with the voice while another part performs routine tasks. This is different from both reading (which demands full attention) and background music (which typically doesn't carry semantic content).</p>
                
                <p><em>Shadowbook</em> imagines a reader-listener: "I imagine someone sitting on a train with their headphones on, looking out the window but with an inward gaze, retreated into an inner silence on the cadence of the words, the voice. Maybe that's not how we listen anymore; we get short voice messages, skip through playlists, need our podcasts to be entertaining."</p>
                
                <p>This tension—between contemplative listening and distracted consumption—characterizes phone-mediated audio. The phone enables both, but tends toward the latter. We speed up playback, skip forward, multitask. The phone makes listening possible everywhere but also makes it harder to listen deeply.</p>

        <!-- COLLAPSIBLE SECTION 10.5 -->
        <details class="section">
            <summary class="section-toggle">10.5 Who Actually Listens?</summary>
            <div class="section-content">
                <p>The essay ends with a question: "We might not be reading as much anymore, but another point is this: who actually listens?"</p>
                
                <p>This cuts to something essential. The phone gives us tools to record, to broadcast, to produce content. But attention remains scarce. Everyone is talking (posting, sharing, recording) but fewer are listening (reading, watching, receiving).</p>
                
                <p>The phone creates an economy of expression where supply vastly exceeds demand. We all have voices, we all have platforms, but we can't all be heard. The result is a kind of speaking into the void, a performance for an imagined audience that may not exist.</p>
                
                <p>"SUBLIMINALITATIONS" embodies this paradox. It's a long monologue spoken to an imagined "you" who may or may not be listening. The essay performs intimate address while acknowledging the likelihood that no one will receive it as intended.</p>
                
                <p>The phone is the infrastructure for this economy—it makes speaking easy, broadcasting trivial, but it can't guarantee listening. The digital animal we've created demands to be fed with content, but it doesn't necessarily consume what we offer.</p>
